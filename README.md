# Strengthening Digital Research Infrastructure at Trillium Health Partners: Advancing Equitable Access for Racialized Researchers

This repository provides an overview of this project aimed at advancing equitable access to digital research infrastructure for racialized researchers. It includes the project's vision, mission, and  roadmap.  


## Vision and Mission

- **Vision:** To improve awareness about digital research infrastructure (DIR) resources and facilitate access to tools and resources about research data management.
  
- **Mission:** The goal of this project is to advance equitable access to digital research infrastructure (DRI) for racialized researchers at Trillium Health Partners.

## About

Racialized researchers experience systemic barriers which affect their ability to make significant strides within academic institutions. Some of these barriers include the lack of awareness about and access to DRI tools and resources. 
In this project, we will conduct a needs assessment survey and training on research data management. The survey will collect data on awareness of the Digital Alliance of Canadaâ€™s DRI services, and barriers and facilitators to accessing these services. A hybrid training will be conducted on best practices for research data management. In addition, training participants will receive information on research data management tools and resources and how to access them.
