# Strengthening Digital Research Infrastructure at Trillium Health Partners: Advancing Equitable Access for Racialized Researchers

This repository provides an overview of this project aimed at advancing equitable access to digital research infrastructure for racialized researchers. It includes the project's vision, mission, and  roadmap.  


## Vision and Mission

- **Vision:** To improve awareness about digital research infrastructure (DIR) resources and facilitate access to tools and resources about research data management.
  
- **Mission:** The goal of this project is to advance equitable access to digital research infrastructure (DRI) for racialized researchers at Trillium Health Partners.

## About

Racialized researchers experience systemic barriers which affect their ability to make significant strides within academic institutions. Some of these barriers include the lack of awareness about and access to DRI tools and resources. 
In this project, we will conduct a needs assessment survey and training on research data management. The survey will collect data on awareness of the Digital Alliance of Canada‚Äôs DRI services, and barriers and facilitators to accessing these services. A hybrid training will be conducted on best practices for research data management. In addition, training participants will receive information on research data management tools and resources and how to access them.

  ## How to contribute?

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. üéâ

This project is being developed **openly** and invites contributions from **anyone interested** in reproducible data science who would like to get involved.
You can suggest topics to include in this repository, report mistakes/bugs, create Pull Requests to fix an error, offer resources or help develop or review the training materials.

‚≠êÔ∏è You are acknowledged for all kinds of contributions

- Raise mistakes, errors or missing information on this repository by opening a [Pull Request](../../pulls)
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue or something you‚Äôve already discussed
  - A Pull Request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
